langchain:
models :models , indexes, hugging face api and local model pull and then run 
prompts : static and dynamic inputs list and single input, meaasges , 


structured output : 
resume extraction to database push
some models can give but some cannot :
with_sturctured_output (): models with struc output
output parser():models without struc 
like tiny llama
class written in langchain are output parsers :
:string op parser
:json 
:structured op parser
:pydantic 

STRING OP:converts to string 
op parser if string is good for pipelining passing data to next node automatically not manually 
tmeplates , models , parser are the nodes and flow can vary acc

JSON PARSER : no schemas inforcing is there in json object theres is a problem 

STRUCTURED OTPUT PARSER : WE CAN ENFORE A SCHEMA :
    NO VALIDATION 
PYDANTIC PARSER:
    validation using pydanitc 

Runnables are a concept that are basically a solution for problem that they have created like diff syntax for diff components then they used Runnables as abstrat classes to have a standard invoke function     


Runnables primitives :
    sequence 
    prallel 
    passthrough
    lambda : custom Runnables based on a function x
    brnach : Conditinal logic and
